title: Let's Start Here

I’m not sure where to start so I’ll start here: _a new post for a refreshed site for a renewed spirit._

The last few months, I had lost the drive to create. Every night when it was time for bed, I wasn’t satisfied with anything I had done that day. I thought new relationships could solve it. I thought new work projects could solve it. Hell, I thought eating a different cereal for breakfast would get me out of this rut. Nope. I longed for the feeling of creating something and being honestly giddy at the final product, and the excitement I’ve come to known with so many great projects I’ve been lucky enough to work on. But, with every change nothing changed.

The more I thought about it, the more I tried to rationalize that it was something that would pass in time. But I slowly began to realize it was something that I needed to be proactive about and continously work on. So, I’ve decided to force myself to do a few things.

## 1. Eat 3 Meals a Day
For far too long, I’ve made it on lunch and dinner skipping arguably the most important meal of the day. Last weekend, I picked up a compact fridge to put in my office to make eating breakfast as easy as possible.

## 2. Reflect
I need to make time for daily reflection, not just when things are extraordinarly good or bad.

## 3. Read
My stack of books to read has been growing taller and taller (Thanks [Scott](http://twitter.com/sesoeder)!) and I need to be reading them instead of dumbing out in front of the television.

## 4. Create
Whether it’s a personal or client project, writing here, or taking a few hours to mess around on the banjo, I need to express myself.

These may seem silly and insignificant to most, but I think being proactive with a few changes can’t hurt…maybe it’ll put me right back on track.
