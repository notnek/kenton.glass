It’s been nearly a year since I’ve taught formally. I quickly remembered how tiring it is to project your voice over a classroom for nearly two hours. And I almost forgot how refreshing and inspiring it was to listen to and answer questions that my students had. Sure, it isn’t a for-credit class, but [it’s a class](http://louisville.edu/lifelonglearning/classes/webtechnologies) where students will immediately take what they’ve learned home and put their new knowledge to work on their personal projects, their business ideas, or as a stepping stone to learning something even greater. And for me…well, it was a chance to try to pass on things I’ve picked up in my short career and hopefully that knowledge transfer will impact one of my students.
