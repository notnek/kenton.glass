The last iteration of my site last nearly two years, which I will proudly claim as a personal record. I had known for a while that I wanted to simplify it even further and of course, add support for all devices instead of my poor 1,000px viewport hack I had before. So I set out this past weekend to refresh my personal site. I ended up moving from static files and Tumblr to WordPress. I’ve been using WordPress a lot lately for clients, and now that I’m teaching another class on the platform, I thought it made sense to build my own site on it. I also hope having these posts on my home page will force me to write more frequently. I’m happy with how everything ended up and it should allow me to focus on some exciting things coming down the pipe.
