Today I made a decision to pivot my life in a new direction. I’m moving to Nashville, Tennessee and joining the [Emma](http://myemma.com/) family as a Front End Developer. I couldn’t be more excited.

Two years ago, I had the privilege of having my print portfolio reviewed by some designers at Emma as well as getting a tour of their awesome office space (which by the way, [they’ve moved](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=9+Lea+Avenue,+Nashville,+TN&hl=en&hnear=9+Lea+Ave,+Nashville,+Tennessee+37210&gl=us&t=h&z=16) and their new space is tops). I left that night with the thought of how fun and interesting it would be to work there. I would have never thought that in Fall 2012, I’d find myself joining the crew with much excitement and eagerness to push the company even further.

I can’t wait to get down to Nashville and get to work.
