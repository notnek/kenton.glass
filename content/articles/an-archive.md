It’s always nice to look back. A few weeks ago, I stopped and took the time to remind myself of some old websites I’ve done that have helped me get to where I am today. Then I thought I might as well share some old things. Here’s a list of projects that didn’t make it or sites that have been replaced, ordered by their last edit.

- [Personal Site [v3]](http://kenton.me/-/archive/v3)
- [Personal Site [v2]](http://kenton.me/-/archive/v2)
- [MetroSoiree](http://kenton.me/-/archive/metrosoiree)
- [Personal Site [v1]](http://kenton.me/-/archive/v1)

For an updated list, I’ve setup an [archive](http://kenton.me/archive).
